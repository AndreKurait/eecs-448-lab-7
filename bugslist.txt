The one bug that causes them all:
isEmpty returns true in all circumstances

This bug may have caused all other invalid operations in the linkedList. Without seeing the implementation it is
impossible to deduce whether or not the other functions are implemented correctly.

Side effects of this bug:

removeFront only returns false
removeBack only returns false
-These can both be explained by having a return false clause at the top of each function if the list isEmpty

addBack is identical to addFront
-addBack(elem) may have been implemented to just return addFront(elem) if the list isEmpty

destructor deletes no allocated memory
-could have been coded to remove all elements unless the list isEmpty then do nothing
